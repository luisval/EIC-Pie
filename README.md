# EIC-Pie
This repository is dedicated to the electron-pion rejection analysis for the EIC experiment.


- CalData is an adaptation of AnaTutorial ( https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/tutorials/tree/master/AnaTutorial) created to save the root       files with the EMCal and HCal information.
- CalData works with the macros located at the repository https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/macros.
